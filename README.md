# PickleRank üèì

A modern, mobile-first application for tracking and ranking pickleball players using an ELO rating system.

## Features

- üîê Google Authentication
- üì± Mobile-first design
- üèÜ ELO-based ranking system (with margin of victory)
- üìä Game score tracking
- üë• Player management
- üëë Admin controls
- üìà Player statistics and history

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase (Authentication & Database)
- ELO Rating System

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a new Firebase project
   - Enable Authentication (Google)
   - Set up Firestore Database
   - Add your Firebase configuration to `.env.local`

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

## Recent Updates

- **ELO System:** ELO now factors in the margin of victory (score difference) for each game, not just win/loss.
- **Game History UI:** 
  - Teams are displayed in a stacked, modern format with a clear winner highlight and trophy.
  - ELO change for each game is shown as a subtle badge under the score.
  - Date/timestamp is tiny and left-aligned at the bottom of each game card for mobile-friendliness.
- **User ELO Sync:** The top-level `elo` field in each user document is always kept in sync with their current season ELO for future features like matchmaking.
- **Scripts:**
  - `scripts/recalculateElos.js`: Recalculates all ELOs for a season, updates rankings, user ELOs, and each game's `eloChange` field.
  - `scripts/syncUserElos.js`: Syncs all users' top-level `elo` field to match their current ELO in the active season's rankings.
- **Admin Controls:** Admins (by phone number) can edit or delete games.

## How ELO Works

- ELO is updated after every game, factoring in both win/loss and the margin of victory.
- Editing or deleting a game triggers a full season ELO recalculation for all players and updates all affected game `eloChange` values.
- ELO change is displayed for each game in match history.

## Scripts

- **Recalculate ELOs:**  
  Run `node scripts/recalculateElos.js <seasonId>` to recalculate all ELOs, update rankings, user ELOs, and each game's `eloChange`.
- **Sync User ELOs:**  
  Run `node scripts/syncUserElos.js` to sync all users' top-level `elo` field to their current ELO in the active season.

## Future Ideas & Discussion

- **Shorten or Remove Games Played in Rankings:**
  - The current display of 'Games: X/X' can push the ELO value off to the side. Consider shortening, reformatting, or removing it for a cleaner look.

- **Gamify ELO/Ranking Progression:**
  - Consider rebranding ELO points to something more addictive and game-like (e.g., 'RR' as in Valorant) to make climbing the leaderboard more engaging.

- **Matchmaker Module:**
  - Add a 'Matchmaker' button under the Season title. This would open a module where users can select which players are present (via checkboxes), and the system suggests fair or randomized teams.
  - Possible parameters: most fair game (by ELO), most randomized, or based on match history (who has played with/against each other the least this season).
  - This could help balance games and keep things fresh and fun.

*These are ideas for future discussion and not yet implemented. Feel free to add, discuss, or refine further!*
